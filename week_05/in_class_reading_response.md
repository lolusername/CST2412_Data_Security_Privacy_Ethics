10-12 minutes

## Length

## Reading Excerpts

### Excerpt A: Shared Responsibility and Real Risk
Cloud security controls are split between provider and customer responsibilities.
When ownership is unclear, incidents get worse because teams assume someone else owns the first fix.

### Excerpt B: Data Minimization and Duty of Care
Security monitoring and response should collect only data needed for a clear purpose.
Fast action matters, but over-collection and unclear retention can create avoidable privacy harm.
