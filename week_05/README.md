# Week 5: Databases, Cloud, and Big Data Security

## Week focus
This module continues directly from Week 4 (host + network defense) and shifts to data-layer and cloud-layer trust.
Core thread for the week:
- prevent disclosure and misuse of sensitive data
- map cloud risk to clear ownership
- apply fast, defensible control prioritization during incidents

## Syllabus alignment
From `CST_2412.pdf`:
- Topic: Databases, Cloud, Big Data Security
- Reading: Chapter 7 and Chapter 8 (Security in Computing)

## Recommended class flow
