# Paper Encryption Lab (Intro, In-Class Only)

## Overview
In this activity, you will work in groups of 2–3 to invent a simple way to hide written messages on paper, then briefly share your method with the class.

## Goals
- Invent a simple paper-and-pencil encryption method.
- Try encrypting and decrypting short messages.
- Share and compare different ideas for hiding information.

## Setup
- Groups: 2–3 students.
- Materials: Paper and pens/pencils.

---

## Part 1 – Brainstorm (5 minutes)
In your group, list **at least 3 ideas** for hiding a message, such as:
- Shifting letters forward/backward in the alphabet.
- Replacing letters with symbols or other letters.
- Scrambling the order of letters or words.
- Hiding a message inside another “normal-looking” sentence.

Give each idea a short name.

## Part 2 – Choose and Build Your Cipher (10–15 minutes)
1. Pick **one** idea to turn into your group’s cipher.  
2. On paper, clearly write:
   - The **secret rule** (the “key”), if there is one.
   - How to **encrypt** a message (step by step).
   - How to **decrypt** a message (step by step).
3. Use your cipher to encrypt **2 short sentences**.

Keep this sheet; you will use it when presenting.

## Part 3 – Quick Swap and Decode (10–15 minutes)
1. Swap encrypted sentences with a nearby group.  
2. First, try to **figure out the rule** and decrypt without hints.  
3. If stuck, get **one small hint** (for example, “we always shift letters by the same amount”).  
4. See how close you can get to the original sentences.

## Part 4 – Group Presentations (10–15 minutes)
Each group gives a **1–2 minute** informal presentation:

- What is the name of your cipher?  
- How does it work, in simple terms?  
- Was it easy or hard for the other group to break? Why do you think that is?

No written work is turned in; the focus is on **sharing ideas and discussion**.

---

During your quick presentations, what is the most important point you want your students to emphasize about their cipher (for example, “how it works” vs. “how easy it was to break”)?
