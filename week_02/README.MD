# CST-2412 Data Privacy & Security Ethics
## Week 2, Day 1 - Introduction

Welcome to the second week of CST-2412 Data Privacy & Security Ethics. During this session, you will build on your understanding of security fundamentals by examining the confidentiality-integrity-availability (CIA) triad, evaluating risks in everyday situations, and experiencing basic cryptographic hashing techniques. You will also reflect on ethical considerations for using data in higher education.

## Preparatory Reading and Media

### Ethical Use of Data - Scenarios for Discussion
Before class, read this short article on the ethical use of data in higher education to prepare for the writing activity. It presents several scenarios that raise questions about privacy, consent, and responsible analytics.

### Hashing Demonstration
We will use an online tool to practice hashing text and files. During the lab portion, you can explore [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) (a free web-based tool) to generate SHA-256 hashes, Base64 encodings, and other transformations. If CyberChef is blocked at your location, try File Checksum Calculator for a simple SHA-256 demonstration.

### Class Notes
Bring any notes or questions about the CIA triad and risk analysis from the previous class. You will be applying these concepts during interactive discussions.

## Writing Response

After reading the Ethical Use of Data article, prepare a short written response (approx. 250-300 words) addressing the following prompts:

1. **Scenario selection:** Choose one scenario from the article that resonates with you. Briefly summarise the situation.
2. **Ethical analysis:** Discuss which ethical principles or privacy issues are at stake. How would you address them if you were a decision-maker? Reference ideas from the reading and from our class discussion about privacy and surveillance.
3. **Personal reflection:** Relate the scenario to your own experiences or expectations in academic or professional settings.

Be ready to share your ideas during class. Your response will help guide small-group discussion.

## Hands-On Lab: Hashing Basics

During class, we will experiment with hashing as a way to ensure data integrity:

1. Visit CyberChef (or the alternative SHA-256 calculator) and enter a short message of your choice. Observe the resulting hash value.
2. Change one character in your message. Compare the new hash to the original and note how dramatically the output differs.
3. Use the tool to upload a small file (e.g., a text file) and compute its hash. Discuss why identical files have identical hashes and why this property is useful for verifying file integrity.
4. Explore the Base64 encode/decode operation in CyberChef. Try encoding and decoding a message to see how data is transformed.

These activities are intended to give you hands-on experience with fundamental cryptographic primitives. The lab material will be demonstrated live in class.

## Expectations for Week 2, Day 1

You should come prepared to engage with the material, participate in discussions, and collaborate with your classmates. The readings and writing response will provide context for our discussion of ethics, while the hashing lab will give you a tangible sense of how security mechanisms work. Feel free to explore the online tool ahead of time if you are curious.

If you have any questions or accessibility concerns about the resources above, please reach out to your instructor before class.
