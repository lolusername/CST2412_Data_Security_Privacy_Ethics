# Week 4 In-Class Reading Response (Student Prompt)

## Time
10-12 minutes

## Length
250-300 words

## **Official Prompt (What You Must Answer)**
Write one short argument that answers this question:

**Which security control should be implemented first in this incident, and why is that choice both technically effective and ethically responsible?**

---

## Reading Excerpts

### Excerpt A: Zero Trust
Traditional security models often assumed that people and devices "inside" a network were mostly trustworthy.  
A zero trust approach rejects that assumption. Every request should be verified using identity, device state, and request context.

### Excerpt B: Monitoring and Privacy
Security monitoring can improve detection speed, but it can also create privacy harm if collection is excessive or unclear.  
Good monitoring should use:
- data minimization (collect only what is needed)
- purpose limitation (clear reason for collection)
- access controls (limit who can view data)
- retention limits (delete data on schedule)

## What Your Response Must Include

1. **Claim (2-3 sentences)**
   - State one clear first control decision.

2. **Evidence (3-4 sentences)**
   - Use at least two details from the excerpts.
   - Explain how each detail supports your claim.

3. **Counterargument (2-3 sentences)**
   - Give one realistic objection to your claim.
   - Respond with a practical adjustment or mitigation.

4. **Ethics Connection (2-3 sentences)**
   - Name one principle: proportionality, transparency, duty of care, or fairness.
   - Explain how your chosen control follows that principle.

5. **Conclusion (1 sentence)**
   - State exactly what should be implemented first and why.
